# Sunshine
Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course. I have created this as a part of quiz/tasks.

It covers the following lessons:

1. Create basic app with List View
2. Connect to Cloud
3. Fragments and Background thread
4. Create Activities and navigate with Intents
5. Activity Lifecycle and Data
6. JUnit TestCases
7. Content Providers
8. Hooking Content Providers with Loaders
9. Rich and Responsive Layout
10. Service and Notifications
11. To run it succesfully, you have to add an api key from http://openweathermap.org/ into build.gradle
